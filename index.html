        <p><b>Bring this 7-layer dip to your next watch party.</b> Football season is in full swing (go Chiefs!),
             and I’ll make this recipe again this weekend. I’ve enjoyed the leftovers for lunch, so you 
             don’t need a big occasion to make this recipe. I hope you love it as much as I do.
