        <p><b>Make this cilantro lime dressing recipe the next time you prepare a Mexican meal.</b> It’s bright, 
            sunny and fresh! This dressing is boldly flavored with fresh lime, olive oil, cilantro, garlic, 
            honey, cumin and Dijon mustard. You can make it creamy or spicy if you wish.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>½ cup lime juice (from about 4 to 6 limes)</li>
            <li>1 cup loosely packed cilantro (mostly leaves, small stems are ok, from about 1 small bunch) </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup, to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>Scant ½ teaspoon fine salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Optional, for spice: 1 small jalapeño, seeds and ribs removed, and roughly chopped, and/or 
                a pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
            
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor or small blender, combine all of the ingredients. Process until the
                 mixture is completely smooth with tiny flecks of cilantro. </li>
            <li>Taste, and adjust as necessary—if the dressing is overwhelmingly tart, add more honey by 
                the teaspoon. If it tastes a little bitter or needs extra oomph, add another pinch or two of 
                salt. For more spice, add a pinch of red pepper flakes. Blend again.  </li>
            <li>Serve immediately or store in a covered jar in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
