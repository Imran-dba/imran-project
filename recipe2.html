        <p><b>This homemade cashew butter recipe is easy to make in a food processor.</b> The trick is to 
            lightly toast your cashews before blending for the best flavor and texture. Even then, cashew 
            butter has a more neutral flavor than most other nut butter. It’s quite versatile.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces (just over 3 cups) unroasted shelled cashews</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon fine salt</li>
            
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h4>steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spread the cashews across a large, rimmed baking 
                sheet and bake them for 10 minutes, stirring halfway. </li>
            <li>Transfer the cashews to a food processor. Add the salt. Blend until the mixture is completely 
                smooth and creamy, pausing to scrape down the sides as necessary. You’ll think it’ll never 
                blend, but be patient! The cashews will go from flour-like clumps to a ball against the side 
                of the food processor, and finally, the mixture will turn lusciously creamy. If the mixture
                 gets hot along the way or your machine seems tired, stop and let it cool for a few 
                 minutes. </li>
            <li>Let the cashew butter cool to room temperature, then transfer the mixture to a mason jar 
                and screw on the lid. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.</li>
